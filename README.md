# Weather
A modern Android weather app built with Kotlin, Room, Coroutines, and Google Maps. It fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeather API, shows current conditions with icons, and stores unique cities locally. Features include location-based updates, foreground service, and a clean UI with RecyclerView.
